Degree days indicators are calculated by integrating over time the absolute difference in temperature
of the medium over a reference temperature. The exact method of calculation may vary;
here the daily maximum near-surface temperature 'tasmax' is used to calculate an annual indicator:

$$
I^\text{dd} = \frac{365}{n_y} \sum_{i = 1}^{n_y} |  T^\text{max}_i - T^\text{ref} | \nonumber
$$

$I^\text{dd}$ is the indicator, $T^\text{max}$ is the daily maximum near-surface temperature, $n_y$ is the number of days in the year and $i$ is the day index.
and $T^\text{ref}$ is the reference temperature of 32Â°C.
