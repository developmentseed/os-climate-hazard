Days per year for which the average near-surface temperature 'tas' is above a threshold specified in °C.

$$
I =  \frac{365}{n_y} \sum_{i = 1}^{n_y} \boldsymbol{\mathbb{1}}_{\; \, T^{avg}_i > T^\text{ref}} \nonumber
$$

$I$ is the indicator, $T^\text{avg}_i$ is the daily average near-surface temperature for day index $i$ in °C, $n_y$ is the number of days in the year
and $T^\text{ref}$ is the reference temperature.
