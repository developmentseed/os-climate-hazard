Weeks per year for which the average water temperature is above a threshold specified in °C:

$$
I =  \frac{52}{n_y} \sum_{i = 1}^{n_y} \boldsymbol{\mathbb{1}}_{\; \, T^{avg}_i > T^\text{ref}} \nonumber
$$

$I$ is the indicator, $T^\text{avg}_i$ is the weekly average water temperature for week index $i$ in °C, $n_y$ is the number of weeks in the sample
and $T^\text{ref}$ is the reference temperature.
